After 2 years of neglecting this blog, I've moved away from wordpress and am hosting it on Github Pages.

The site is built using <a href="http://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.

Source repo : <a href="https://github.com/sajal/sajalblog">https://github.com/sajal/sajalblog</a> <br />
Built pages : <a href="https://github.com/sajal/sajal.github.io">https://github.com/sajal/sajal.github.io</a>

Some links, especially RSS URLs might be broken currently.
