A while ago, clicking on the "tweet" button of a <a href="http://failblog.org/2010/10/26/epic-fail-photos-xbox-message-win/">funny FAIL</a> in <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a> gave me the scare of my life. 

First reaction: How did my twitter theme change?
Second reaction: When did i start tweeting/reading in Thai?
Third reaction: When did I change into a <a href="http://a2.twimg.com/profile_images/994651514/32086_403053037679_556887679_4991310_709940_n_bigger.jpg">pretty girl</a>?

I was logged in as someone else! Thats probably what brain transplant(when possible) would feel like...

In other words, the transparent proxy at <a href="http://www.thailandinternet.com/" title="really crappy internet provider in Thailand">True</a> simply fucked up... can't do anything about it. There is probably someone else in Thailand having the time of his/her life browsing into my account and poking into my disgusting life...

So, the solution for me would be to use a secure tunnel bypassing True's evil session hijacking transparent proxy all together.. Which is kinda illegal I've been told... and also who will protect me from all the porn(and evil propaganda) on the interwebs ;)
