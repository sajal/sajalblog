Dear Sirs or Madams,

This is to bring to your notice that almost all notebooks available in Thailand come bundled with windows preloaded.

I had purchased a Sony VAIO 3 or 4 years ago which came bundled with Windows XP. Due to quality problems in the software provided, I had to switch over to a different Operating System. I have no claims on the licensing fee of the inferior software provided to me as during the time of purchase I had intended to use it, and I did for quite a while.

Now, the time has come for me to purchase a new notebook. A self conducted study at fortune town on June 20th 2008 reviled that almost <strong>all notebooks came with Windows pre-installed and the license bundled</strong>. On asking any of the vendors that I don't want to pay for the license, I was informed it is impossible. The very limited selection of notebooks which do come without Windows pre-installed are bottom of the line models which are usually outdated or very heavy.

<strong>My questions to all of the addresses</strong> :-
<ol>
	<li>Do you assume a non-windows user to not be able to afford your mid-segment notebooks?</li>
	<li>Is your intention to force Linux users into buying a Windows license?</li>
	<li>Is this an effort to form a cartel against Linux?</li>
</ol>
<strong>Question to all the notebook vendors</strong> :-
<ol>
	<li>Do you refund any difference amount in case the buyer does not use the license?</li>
</ol>
<strong>Question to Lenovo</strong> :-
<ol>
	<li>Lenovo USA does offer an interesting range of notebooks without Windows. Does Lenovo Thailand do the same?</li>
</ol>
<strong>Question to Microsoft :-</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Do you refund any unused windows License?</li>
	<li>I am aware of the software piracy issues in Thailand, but have you ever conducted a study as to how many non-windows users own a windows license? Do you reduce this number when publishing piracy rates?</li>
</ol>
Please respond, via comment form below in English only. The replies would help me decide weather or not to get a new notebook here in Thailand or order it in the States or Singapore, potentially making the Thai Government suffer a loss of tax revenue.

PS : Apologies to other companies who fit my criteria and I missed them out! They are also free to respond.

Regards,
Sajal Kayan
