It was one of those days where instead of doing some productive work, I was wasting my time comparing my alexa graph to competitors. I don't know what got into me I decided to compare <a href="http://www.thaindian.com/" title="Indians in Thailand" target="_blank">Thaindian</a>'s traffic to <a href="http://blognone.com/" title="Tech News That's Worth" target="_blank">Blognone</a>'s. Look at what I found!

<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/ti-blognone.png" rel="lightbox" title="Thaindian.comâ€™s traffic exceeds blognone!"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/ti-blognone1.png" alt="ti-blognone1.png" border="0" /></a>

Blognone is to Thais' what Slashdot is to the world.
