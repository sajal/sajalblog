A little excited about <a href="http://www.barcampbangkok.org/" target="_blank">BarCamp Bangkok</a>. Never participated in any in-the-flesh Geek meet. In touch with JFXBurns and <a href="http://sugree.com/" title="Sugree's Blog" target="_blank">Sugree</a> who are working hard behind the scene and proposed <a href="http://sugree.com/node/19" target="_blank">Indus as a possible venue</a> for the event. The date has been (kinda) finalized for 26th January (Also India's Republic Day ).

So same day about one month from now, Ill have many things to do. Attend flag hoisting at the embassy, Spend a lot of time at Queen Sirikit National Convention Center ( India Education Fair on 26th and 27th Jan, Thaindian.com has a booth there <em>visit us</em> ), and also attend the BarCamp to which I look forward to. My only worry is whether they will allow me to enter the BarCamp dressed in formals ;-)
