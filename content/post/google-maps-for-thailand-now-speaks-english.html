The moment I <a href="http://www.johnberns.com/2008/02/21/google-maps-now-has-thailand-street-maps-in-english/" target="_blank">heard about this</a> I couldn't help myself, still jumping with Joy. Google has finally answered <a href="http://www.thechurchofgoogle.org/Scripture/google_prayers.html" target="_blank">my prayers</a>... Gives me great plans for my <strong><a href="http://www.chalothailand.com/" title="Travel to Thailand" target="_blank">travel portal</a></strong>. I can now increase the usability for my visitors as well as <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/sitemap.html" target="_blank">increase traffic</a> to the site...

Now off to learning javascript and the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/" target="_blank">Google Maps API</a>. After that have to look for sources for GPS data... In case anyone knows of a good <strong>Quick n Dirty tutorial</strong>, please drop the link in the comments.
