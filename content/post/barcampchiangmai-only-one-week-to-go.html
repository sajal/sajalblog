This coming Saturday the geeks of Thailand are gonna congregate at Chiang Mai for the very first <a href="http://www.barcampchiangmai.org" target="_blank">BarCamp at Chiang Mai</a>. In fact May 2008 is the month for camping (ignore the heat and rain, geeks camp in Air Conditioned rooms). <a href="/tag/barcampchiangmai">BarCampChiangMai</a> on 17th May, and <a href="http://www.barcampbangkok.org/drupalcamp-overview">DrupalCamp</a> Bangkok on 24th May both of which I intend to attend and <a href="http://www.barcampchiangmai.org/users/view/22" target="_blank">probably speak</a> at if I manage to hack up something worth presenting about.

The <a href="/barcampbangkok-winter-2008-a-huge-success.html" title="BarCampBangkok winter 2008 a HUGE success!">HUGE success at BarCampBangkok</a> has shown the Thai geeks the need for more such events. In fact some of the attendees of <a href="/tag/barcampbangkok">BarCampBangkok</a> have been organizing a monthly <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/barcampbangkok4ever" target="_blank">BarcampBangkok4Ever</a> which is a smaller casual gathering of geeks at a coffee shop.

FYI
<blockquote> <em>BarCamp is an international network of user-generated conferences — open, participatory workshop-events, whose content is provided by participants — often focusing on early-stage web applications, and related open source technologies, social protocols, and open data formats. The event will be bilingual, in both English and Thai.</em><em>There is no audience, only participants. All participants should give a demo, a session, photos, videos or anything else. All presentation are scheduled immediately before the event by reserving slots at the venue.</em>

<em>Anyone with something to contribute is welcome.</em></blockquote>
The BarCamp at Chiang Mai would be organized on May 17, 2008 from 1000-1800 hrs at Payap University and is sponsored by Payap University, Codegent and Creative Hacker. With one more week to go <a href="http://www.barcampchiangmai.org/users/registrants/" target="_blank">59 people have registered</a> to participate. I would be staying the night of 17th at Chiang Mai and am <strong>looking for a roomie</strong> for the night to share the room expense. In case anyone is interested please leave a comment.
