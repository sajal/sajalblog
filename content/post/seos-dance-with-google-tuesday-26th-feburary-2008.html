Yesterday was<strong> Google Dance day</strong> and the SEOs are perhaps still dancing today (Tuesday in US). Some say that <strong>page rank is useless</strong>, but i tend to believe it has some relevance. At least it is an <strong>indicative of the link authority of the site</strong>.

First noticed it yesterday evening(early a.m. in US) when <a href="http://www.barcampbangkok.org/" title="The first BarCamp in Thailand" target="_blank">BarCampBangkok homepage</a> showed pagerank 4. This was a direct jump from no rank. This is the result of loads of Bangkok based Geeks linking to BarCampBangkok from their blogs and sites. I too am guilty of providing a site wide link :)

Another surprising change I noticed was our <strong><a href="http://www.chalothailand.com/" title="Travel to Thailand">travel portal</a></strong>. Until yesterday, it had no page rank. The site has had site wide links from my other sites. Until a month ago all it had on it was meaningless <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum" title="Lorem Ipsum" target="_blank">Lipsum</a>, I've been adding content to it only since 5 weeks ago and it is a slow and painful process. But the bottom line is site wide links from 2 domains can get a site's homepage to page rank 5?

Pagerank updates may not have finished, the results mentioned here may change. In the <a href="/google-dance-day-today-how-has-been-the-response-for-you.html" title="Google dance day today - How has been the response for you?">last Google Dance</a> my <a href="http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal" title="News from India, Thailand and the World" target="_blank">news site</a> also jumped from 0 to 5. <strong>Thank you Google. </strong>
