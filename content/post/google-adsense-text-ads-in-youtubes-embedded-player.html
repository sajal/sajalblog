Today while searching for photography tutorials, i landed up on <a href="http://www.cameratown.com/guides/" target="_blank">Cameratown's tutorial page</a>. Surprisingly, there was a contextual text ad for "Canon Flash Photography" on it. Wonder if it is a new phenomenon, searching on <a href="/tag/google">Google</a> would only lead me to articles/posts about the adsense video ad units. Take a look at the image below, it shows the <strong>adsense text ad within the video</strong>.

Is this something Google is doing to <strong>monetize Youtube</strong> or there is some involvement/share of Cameratown in this case? On refreshing the page I couldn't get the ad back, neither have I seen this ad unit on other embedded youtube videos. Lucky that I took a screen shot in time.

If you have any more info on this phenomenon then do let me know.
