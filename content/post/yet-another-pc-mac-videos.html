Seems some people just wont stop making us laugh and bring out the truth. A couple of months ago I showed my Fedora 7 loaded notebook to someone (who has both mac and a windows workstations). She immediately  commented.. "ohh that looks like a mix of mac and windows.". I guess this video explains it.
