On last week's <a href="http://www.seroundtable.com/archives/016868.html" target="_blank">Video Recap of Weekly Search Buzz</a>, <a href="http://www.cartoonbarry.com/about.html">Barry Schwartz</a> of <a href="http://www.seroundtable.com" target="_blank">seroundtable.com</a> said he would is expecting schwag from a few companies, and he ran a video contest. The contest was to predict which companies schwag would arrive first. The correct entries would get the schwag as a prize. Here was my answer.
<blockquote><em>great show.
for the quiz id say its Google!</em>

<em>i dont want others schwag :) </em></blockquote>
Now, I would get the schwag only if Google's schwag came first and and <a href="http://www.seroundtable.com/archives/016930.html" target="_blank">it did</a>. I already have one <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sajalkayan/2221137392/in/set-72157603798421941/">Google Shirt</a> which i won answering an easier question <a href="/barcampbangkok-winter-2008-a-huge-success.html" title="BarCampBangkok winter 2008 a HUGE success!">at Barcamp Bangkok</a>. Now this would be my second. Google schwag is not so common in this part of the world where we don't have many webmaster conferences or events.
