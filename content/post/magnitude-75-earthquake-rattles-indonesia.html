People from <strong>Medan(</strong>310 KM from epicenter) have <strong>informed thaindian.com</strong> about feeling the<strong> tremors in Medan</strong>. <strong>Simeulue is an Island 150 km of the west coast of Sumatra.</strong></p>
Simeulue was also dangerously close to the epicenter of the <strong>2004 Indian Ocean earthquake</strong>, which caused the massive <strong>tsunami,</strong> the people in the region are <strong>familiar with earthquakes and tsunamis</strong>. Local folklore has it that a huge earthquake and tsunami hit Simeulue in 1907, killing many of its inhabitants. Many died when people rushed to the beach when they saw the water recede, exposing the coral and fish. They went to collect the fish not realizing that the water would come back with a vengeance.<!--more-->

<strong>Simeule Island</strong> is also very close to <strong>Nias Island</strong> where the quake on March 28, 2005 is regarded as the <strong>second-most powerful earthquake in the world since 1965</strong>

The epicenter of the quake being so close to <strong>Sumatra</strong>, caused tremors all over Sumatra.

The epicenter is relatively close to Major cities like <strong>Singapore</strong> and <strong>Kuala Lumpur.</strong>

At the time of writing, there has been no reports of any <strong>Tsunami Warning</strong> or any reports of <strong>tremors felt in Thailand</strong>. <strong>Thaindian.com</strong> will keep you updated of any developments<strong>
