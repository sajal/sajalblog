Yesterday, DFP launched <a href="http://www.google.com/support/dfp_sb/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=181071">asynchronous ad loading</a>. For the past few months ive <a href="/optimizing-dfp-performance.html" title="Optimizing DFP performance">been</a> <a href="/complete-asynchronous-ad-loading-using-dfp-and-labjs.html" title="Complete Asynchronous ad loading using DFP and LABjs">trying</a> to load ads in a manner where it doesn't affect rest of the page load, this new development is like a dream come true.
