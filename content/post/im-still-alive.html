As some of you may have noticed (or not!) I haven't updated my blog in the last 11 days... Maybe someone gets the wrong idea that I was kidnapped by some M$ goons and brainwashed or something. This post simple proves that I am still here and here to stay!

Just some of my projects are taking a lot of my time. I have the following planned out for my blog.
