I am often curious as to what bots are going on my site at any given moment. So much so that I devote one terminal tab to running this script.

save the following as say bot.sh and make it executable :-

<pre lang="bash">#!/bin/bash
watch "grep $1 /path/to/access.log | tail -15"</pre>
note: the number after tail can be adjusted depending on your terminal size...

Run it on the server as :-

<pre lang="shell">[user@server ~]# ./bot.sh Googlebot</pre>

OR

<pre lang="shell">[user@server ~]# ./bot.sh msnbot</pre>

OR

<pre lang="shell">[user@server ~]# ./bot.sh <suspicious ip address></pre>

and so on....

<pre lang="bash">#!/bin/bash
watch "tail -f /path/to/access.log | grep $1"</pre>
