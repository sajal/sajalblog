<strong>... well not yet...</strong>

Just a while ago, <a href="http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/sci-tech/download-google-chrome_10091512.html">Google launched their own browser Chrome</a>. It does look good, has many cool features, more secure, more stable, but still a beta. And this time its really a beta. Currently its available only for windows, however the main point is that its opensource and a Linux and Mac builds are expected soon.

My 5 minute experience with Chrome.

Screen 1 &gt; Every thing looks good...

Screen 2 &gt; Overflow!!

And No! I dont use windows! <del datetime="2008-09-02T19:36:40+00:00">Just fired up VMware with Windoze XP to test Chrome</del>

PS : If anyone got <strong>Chrome working with wine on Linux</strong> do gimme a buzz. Would like to know.
